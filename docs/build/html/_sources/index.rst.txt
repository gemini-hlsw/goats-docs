GOATS: Gemini Observation and Analysis of Targets System
========================================================

**GOATS** is a browser-based user interface providing an end-to-end automation of the entire time-domain/multi-messenger astronomy follow-up process -- from target selection, over triggering of follow-up observation, over data retrieval, to data reduction and analysis. 

It serves as a Target and Observation Manager (TOM) that can be used out-of-the-box. It is built using the |TOMToolkit|, however it, in itself, is not a toolkit but a fully-assembled TOM. Its main motivation is to lower the entry barrier for the user community.

   Schematic of GOATS, highlighting its building blocks. 

The main components of GOATS are highlighted in :numref:`goats-schematic` above. It is primarily directed towards Gemini follow-up observations, while leveraging complementary services (see :ref:`below <building-blocks>`) for time-domain astronomy built by programs across the larger NOIRLab organization.

Building blocks of GOATS
========================
GOATS relies on the following components - 

* |ANTARES| : NOIRLab's alert broker for target selection.
* |TOMToolkit| : Software for building and customizing TOMs developed by the Las Cumbres Observatory. It includes a plugin for triggering Gemini. 
* |GOA| : Gemini data archive.
* |DRAGONS| : Gemini data reduction software.
* |Dlab| : NOIRLab's science platform, which provides access to various legacy catalogs and a JupyterHub environemnt.
